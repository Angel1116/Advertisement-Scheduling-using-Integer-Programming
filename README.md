After downloding all the datasets and codes, you can run "optimization.py" to optimize the ad scheduling.

The programming structure chart shows as follows:

You can follow the command and input. For example, if you choose the first choice, you would input as follows:

After running the second choice, it would output the schedule in Excel.
If you don't have enough time to execute the code, you could download example "schedule_1.xlsx" to check the output schedule.

If you choose the second choice, you could choose "sample_A_df.csv" or "sample_B_df.csv" or "sample_C_df.csv" to upload and input as follows:

After running the second choice, it would output the schedule in Excel and a bar chart about Jaccard similarity as follows:

If you don't have enough time to execute the code, you could download example "schedule_1.xlsx" to check the output schedule.
